Hello Lee !!
Can you try to reproduce this Problem again having Tracing of the Data Guard Broker enabled this Time:

DGMGRL> edit configuration set property 'TraceLevel' = 'SUPPORT';
Reproduce the Problem
DGMGRL> edit configuration set property 'TraceLevel' = 'USER';

-> further Tracing will be written into the DRC.LOGs of all Instances, so upload the ALERT.LOGs and DRC.LOGs from all participating Instances covering this Attempt afterwards.

Thank you and kind regards
