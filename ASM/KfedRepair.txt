10:14:10 AM Lee Hallwood/contr/cfs - ok, so we can see this these disks look different from an oracle perspective

10:21:08 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - so as u can see the 4 disks are the same as from 2012  
10:21:40 AM Lee Hallwood/contr/cfs - ok, so the change last night, has that been backed out now?  
10:22:03 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - 9 10 11 and 12 were added in the same fashion for the safewatch upgrade  
10:22:15 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - yes we are back to as we was b4 we started  
10:22:43 AM Lee Hallwood/contr/cfs - ok, so could anything have corrupted the disks??  
10:24:10 AM John Flynn/opsrv/ict/cfs - This is on metalink:  
10:24:12 AM John Flynn/opsrv/ict/cfs - This issue could be caused by the "RESERVE POLICY" settings on the hdisks which are used for ASM.
If the disks are not visible as shared disks (means if 'reserve_lock=yes') this can cause problems
with mounting the disks.

If you change the multipathing driver for existing ASM disks the ODM template in AIX will
use the default "RESERVE POLICY" for the asm disks again, which is 'reserve_lock=yes'.

On the other side by changing the disk attribute reserve_lock to 'no' to an existing ASM disk may 
corrupt the ASM disk header rendering the ASM disk unusable.  
10:26:42 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - reserve_policy no_reserve Reserve Policy True
  
10:28:48 AM Lee Hallwood/contr/cfs - john, rob may have spotted something, give him 10 mins  
10:28:59 AM John Flynn/opsrv/ict/cfs - ok  
10:32:54 AM Lee Hallwood/contr/cfs - just nipping the shops, be back in 15  
10:33:01 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - k  
10:33:22 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - john will be handing over in a mo

10:37:54 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - hi john can you stop and restart please  
10:38:21 AM John Flynn/opsrv/ict/cfs - ok  
10:41:12 AM John Flynn/opsrv/ict/cfs - I've restarted asm doesn't look any different, I'll try shutting it all down & restarting again

10:53:03 AM Lee Hallwood/contr/cfs - ok, cool

11:03:34 AM John Flynn/opsrv/ict/cfs - still the same

11:09:02 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - do u think having PVIDs on may affect - havin said that its not affected the others  
11:09:36 AM Lee Hallwood/contr/cfs - yeah, we shouldn't/don't require PVID on asm disks, worth trying  
11:10:20 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - well the pvids are on at the back end VIO level  
11:10:57 AM Lee Hallwood/contr/cfs - ok, they're not on the box are they  
11:11:16 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - no - i removed em  
11:11:44 AM Lee Hallwood/contr/cfs - ok, and for live we have PVIDs on the VIO level?  
11:11:53 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - let me chk  
11:13:37 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - yea we have pvids on the VIO backind devs as they are part of a VG and we pass up LV slices  
11:14:14 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - at the client end there is no pvids  
11:14:22 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - so prod and dr the same  
11:14:50 AM Lee Hallwood/contr/cfs - ok, so probably not that  
11:15:02 AM Lee Hallwood/contr/cfs - ok, probably have two choices here  
11:15:21 AM Lee Hallwood/contr/cfs - Raise a sev 1 SR with Oracle and get them involved   
11:15:29 AM Lee Hallwood/contr/cfs - or  
11:16:04 AM Lee Hallwood/contr/cfs - try that fix that you come across john, if that doesn't fix dd the disks and try to create the diskgroups - if that works rebuild DR  
11:16:39 AM John Flynn/opsrv/ict/cfs - ok may as well have a go with the disk repair utility then  
11:16:52 AM Lee Hallwood/contr/cfs - ok  
11:16:54 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - sounds like a good first option  
11:17:22 AM John Flynn/opsrv/ict/cfs - may as well shut down asm then first  
11:18:25 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - just let me completely confirm that there are no reserves  
11:18:37 AM Lee Hallwood/contr/cfs - k  
11:19:41 AM Lee Hallwood/contr/cfs - rob, are we on one of these disks  
11:19:43 AM Lee Hallwood/contr/cfs - SS, EMC, HDS, CLARiiON, or MPIO-capable disks reserve_policy no_reserve

  
11:19:58 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - MPIO-capable disks reserve_policy no_reserve  
11:20:49 AM Lee Hallwood/contr/cfs - cool  
11:21:26 AM John Flynn/opsrv/ict/cfs - are we ready to have a go with this then:  
11:21:27 AM John Flynn/opsrv/ict/cfs - kfed repair /dev/rhdisk4  
11:21:39 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - OK can confirm all ASM disks that are presented at the cbackend VIO level have no reserve on botyh VIOs  
11:21:51 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - and this reflects at the client end as well  
11:22:13 AM Lee Hallwood/contr/cfs - ok, cool.   
11:22:35 AM Lee Hallwood/contr/cfs - not sure John, do you think worth raising with oracle first  
11:22:47 AM Lee Hallwood/contr/cfs - or do we think we've got nothing to lose trying this  
11:23:21 AM John Flynn/opsrv/ict/cfs - it's a last resort  
11:23:42 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - just lookin at the googled thread for that cmd  
11:24:19 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - Oracle ASM Patchset 11.1.0.7 has a feature where it stores a backup of the header block. This is how you restore it:

- Checked for damage to ASM metadata:
1. kfed read /dev/ora_asm_disk_4 - showed the disk header zeroed out...
2. kfed read /dev/ora_asm_disk_4 blkn=1 - free space table intact, this is good...
3. kfed read /dev/ora_asm_disk_4 (few other blocks in AU0) - allocation table blocks,
all fine...
4. kfed read /dev/ora_asm_disk_4 aun=1 blkn=255 - this is where we keep the disk header copy, and it was there...

- The above meant that only disk header was damaged and that we should be able to repair that...

- Dismounted disk group DBGRP1 on node 1...

- Took backup of the first 2 MB of disk ora_asm_disk_4:

dd if=/dev/ora_asm_disk_4 bs=1024l cont=2 of=/oracle/ora_asm_disk_4.dd

- Repaired the disk header:

kfed repair/dev/ora_asm_disk_4

- After this we were able to mount disk group DBGRP1 on both nodes...

- And open the database intances in both nodes...

Without that patchset, don't think about it

11:26:54 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - devils advocate here .. how long would it take to rebuild this ?  
11:26:55 AM John Flynn/opsrv/ict/cfs - they may well suggest running that repair, at least it would be under guidance  
11:27:06 AM Lee Hallwood/contr/cfs - ok, go for it  
11:27:18 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - nice one centurion

11:30:56 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - when we do fsck its takes ages  
11:31:33 AM John Flynn/opsrv/ict/cfs - yeh!! I think it has a copy of the disk header further down the disk so just copies that back  
11:32:30 AM Rob Marsh/opsrv/ict/cfs - same ?  
11:32:32 AM John Flynn/opsrv/ict/cfs - looks like it has worked
